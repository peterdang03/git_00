## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Lingering onward dreamily  
In an evening of July --  
Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
He halted in the wind, and â€” what was that  
Far in the maples, pale, but not a ghost?  
He stood there bringing March against his thought,  
And yet too ready to believe the most.  

"Oh, that's the Paradise-in-bloom," I said;  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
